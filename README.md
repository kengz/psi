## Installation

Make sure you have `node>v7` and `python3`. See `bin/setup` for the full dependency. Git clone this cray and cd into it.

```shell
npm run setup # system dependencies
npm install # node modules
python setup.py install # pip dependencies
```


## Run

We use `async/await`, so run `node` with the harmony flag. But for safe practices, run all commands via `npm`:

```shell
npm start
```

Alternatively to test-run a single script, use node with flag
```shell
node --harmony-async-await src/index.js
```

### Pre-commit checks

- `npm run lint` Style-check your code with `eslint`
- `npm test` Run tests
